My name is Andrew McClelland, I am a Lead Interior Designer and BIM/Computational Design/ Generative Design and Ai/Automation dork. This blog is my place to share my Revit and Dynamo findings, to try new things and hopefully log/document such findings for personal growth and for organizing and referencing sources/ tools, fixes and testing I do as I dive into Dynamo, Revit API, C# Python, PyRevit and much more

Please keep in mind:

- This blog contains my own opinions and do not reflect those of my employer.
- I am not affiliated with Autodesk in anyway.
- Any workflows are presented without any guarantees or warranty.
