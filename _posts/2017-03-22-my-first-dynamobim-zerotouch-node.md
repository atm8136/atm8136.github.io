## My first #DynamoBIM ZeroTouch Node

Something that has been on my todo list for a very long time is adding zero touch nodes to Rhythm. Why? Because dropdowns are awesome, that's why! :)

I present to you, my very first ZeroTouch Node!
![spaceTypes.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/spaceTypes.png)

This node collects all of the space types from the document and allows the user to select one for use.

While it doesn't seem like a lot, it really represents a lot of progress on my end. I have been learning C# on nights and weekends and I think I might be starting to get it. That and Konrad was a great help, specifically on this Dynamo post.

Stay tuned!
