This post will be a little different, but still really fun.

Often times while I am building things, I like to have fun with it. If you follow me on twitter you have probably seen a fair share of memes and other GIFs(with a J) used in fun ways.

Here are a few below:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last one for today. Happy Friday everyone! ðŸ˜Ž <a href="https://t.co/d8MBqd8whg">pic.twitter.com/d8MBqd8whg</a></p>&mdash; john pierson ðŸ¤¡ðŸŽˆ (@60secondrevit) <a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit/status/1083877682734030848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;You can&#39;t use memes in your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Revit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Revit</a> add-ins&quot;<br>Me: <a href="https://t.co/Bg4INWNumJ">pic.twitter.com/Bg4INWNumJ</a></p>&mdash; john pierson ðŸ¤¡ðŸŽˆ (@60secondrevit) <a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit/status/1086247852580302849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2019</a></blockquote>

On the surface, some of these things can be looked at as "screwing around" or "a waste of time". This is, in fact, the opposite of how I feel about these explorations. I find that if I am having fun with the thing I am creating I will be more interested and determined to get it done. Along the way, I happen to learn a ton of new things. If you all remember, my journey through Dynamo and programming has been a long one with a lot of frustrations and twists and turns. ðŸ˜Š The Revit Kid was nice enough to have me as a guest to discuss it, check it out [here](http://therevitkid.blogspot.com/2017/11/another-dynamo-journey-story.html).

As I continue along this journey I am constantly reminded of Rule 17 of ["Pixar's 22 Rules for Great Storytelling"](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5916970/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar).

Most often when I build something that is for fun, I end up reusing the methods I learned along the way elsewhere. A great example is this one that came up here:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">ðŸ˜Ž <a href="https://t.co/p3DT4dvyMW">pic.twitter.com/p3DT4dvyMW</a></p>&mdash; john pierson ðŸ¤¡ðŸŽˆ (@60secondrevit) <a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit/status/1086277345332289537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2019</a></blockquote>

Within the clippy tool, I learned about non-modal Revit windows and a lot about converting an open source library for use in Revit add-in development.

To summarize, keep having fun everyone! You might just learn something new.
