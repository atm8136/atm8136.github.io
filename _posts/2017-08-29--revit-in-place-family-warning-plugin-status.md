## #Revit In Place Family Warning Plugin - Status

Hey Everyone,

Recently, I have been teasing a plugin that I have been working on in my free time through twitter. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Revit?src=hash">#Revit</a> In Place Family warning plugin is coming along nicely. ðŸ˜Ž <a href="https://t.co/W6Q6ywOQBA">pic.twitter.com/W6Q6ywOQBA</a></p>&mdash; john pierson (@60secondrevit) <a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit/status/901070473752072197">August 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More progress! Next up, a user configurable text file for the password. ðŸ˜Ž <a href="https://t.co/WLav5WoBP9">pic.twitter.com/WLav5WoBP9</a></p>&mdash; john pierson (@60secondrevit) <a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit/status/902672713931677696">August 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

This has been a really fun process and has seen some great response! I have also learned a lot along the way.

**Where are we at now?**

Well, the plugin is all done with a config file for custom password and it runs well, (finally). The only thing left is to sign this thing. If you were not aware code signing is now kind of mandatory for Revit addins to eliminate that super annoying message as seen below.



After some research on Konrad's blog, http://archi-lab.net/code-signing-of-your-revit-plug-ins/, I am finding that I need to invest in one of these fancy certificates. After selecting a vendor, I found out that the cost of this certificate is going to be around $340! Not the easiest thing to soak up when I made this plugin to distribute for free.

So now I am left with two choices.

1. Charge for the plugin (something like .99 cents)
2. See if the community wants to help fund this via crowdfunding.

Before I make any decisions, I wanted to see what everyone thinks. (comment below or respond on twitter)

Also, here is the original thread that inspired this.
