## Thoughts on the DynAwards

_This post may be a little different than the norm._

Recently my buddies over at [designtech](http://designtech.io) celebrated their 1 year birthday. This is very awesome because they honestly do great work and this is a great milestone for them. Congratulations fellas!

Along with this birthday, they decided it would be fun to have a community driven "awards show" for Dynamo package creators. There are several categories to choose from and there are some great names on the list.
Please, go check it out [here](http://designtech.io/computation/introducing-designtech-dynawards/), go on, I'll wait.

After I headed over to their voting page I noticed that I made the list. Rhythm is in the "heavy hitters" category. Immediately I thought, "Wow, what an honor that my work is allowed to appear next to the greats". The people that my work appears next to are honestly the people I learned from as well. If it weren't for people like Andreas, Konrad or Dimitar, I am not sure I would have the knowledge I have today!
