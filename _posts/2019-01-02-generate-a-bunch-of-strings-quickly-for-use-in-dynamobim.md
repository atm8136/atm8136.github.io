## Generate a Bunch of Strings Quickly for Use in #DynamoBIM

Often times I find myself needing to get a bunch of text in Dynamo quickly for a sample file. There are a lot of different ways to do this, but one of my favorites is to tap into data that is freely available.

Stumbling across Jostein's blog post, [here](http://jbdynamo.blogspot.com/2016/06/star-wars-api-and-dynamo.html), it seemed like using the Star Wars API for this was perfect, (And fun).

Over at Jostein's post he has examples on how to use the custom nodes he made for Dynamo for this task. In addition to his nodes, I thought it would be cool to play around with [Radu Gidei's](https://github.com/radumg) [DynaWeb](https://github.com/radumg/DynaWeb) package for this task. 

So here it is, the simple graph below shows how to retrieve 45 unique strings from the Star Wars API for downstream use.

Have fun and Happy New Year, everyone!
