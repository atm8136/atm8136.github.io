<p>So, I have been playing around with Dynamo player quite a bit since it came out.</p> <p>Initially I was a little bummed out that any OOTB nodes for selection were not working. Luckily this is not true for custom python nodes as pointed out on the forums here, <a title="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/revit-2017-1-dynamo-player/6729/12?u=john_pierson" href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/revit-2017-1-dynamo-player/6729/12?u=john_pierson">https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/revit-2017-1-dynamo-player/6729/12?u=john_pierson</a>. The funny thing is, this example actually used one of my nodes from Rhythm!</p> <p>After the ability to select was demonstrated, I decided we neeed some text box input as well. After dissecting a few of Dimitarâ€™s awesome nodes, I finally came up with a solution.</p> <p>Enter, the Rhythm.TextBoxInput node.</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9ZWeVjdnyEE/WBdEUFjc9YI/AAAAAAAABnw/f4JXxws2YCw/s1600-h/Rhythm.TextBoxInput%25255B5%25255D.png"><img title="Rhythm.TextBoxInput" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Rhythm.TextBoxInput" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kKYIq1U8F60/WBdEUiKZ29I/AAAAAAAABn0/7CJm4ttHy9Q/Rhythm.TextBoxInput_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="240" height="122"></a></p> <p>This node will provide a popup that allows the user to enter a string to use for whatever is needed.</p> <p><br>See it in action below, (there is audio so be warned).</p> <p><iframe height="620" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/f1d7c571-7eda-4bba-9e34-05b083036007" frameborder="0" width="640" webkitallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> <p>Get it in the latest version of Rhythm and have fun!</p> <p>-johnP</p>
