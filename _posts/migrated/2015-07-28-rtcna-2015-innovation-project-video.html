<p>Upon registration for RTC this year there was one simple question added regarding something you did that was innovative this year.</p> <p>Considering I had just learned Dynamo at AU2014 and just released the Rhythm package for Dynamo in February, I considered that the most innovative thing I did.</p> <p>When all of the submissions were narrowed down and videos created, there were eight finalists.</p> <p>My video was one of them and was allowed to be played at the Gala dinner.</p> <p>Unfortunately I didn’t win, but it was some <strong>amazing</strong> advertisement for both DynamoBIM and Rhythm.</p> <p>After the “commercial” aired, I had Matt Jezyk and Zach Kron ask me if the video was available anywhere. You can now view it below and thank you everyone for interest in Rhythm and DynamoBIM! (Note: there is no sound in the video because they requested it purely be text. (<em>They did play it with AC/DC’s “Back in Black” playing in the background though</em><img title="Cool" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.revitforum.org/images/smilies/custom/cool.gif">)</p><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_4eJlimsAM?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>-JohnP</p>
