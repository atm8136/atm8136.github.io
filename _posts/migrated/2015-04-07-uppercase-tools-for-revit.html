<p>Currently there are a few paid add ins out there that can provide text case options for your Revit model.</p> <p>The items they are able to control are:</p> <ul> <li>Text  <li>Level Names  <li>Room Names  <li>Sheet Names  <li>View Names (title on sheet)</li></ul> <p>This is very important because the typical standard is to use all caps for documents.</p> <p>Dynamo is able to do this very well and that is Rhythm tool #2.</p> <p>In the video I show all of the items it can change before and after. The inputs for on/off is simply a Boolean (true for on/false for off)</p> <p>See below for this tool in action.</p><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVvSqmpmY5Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen></iframe>
