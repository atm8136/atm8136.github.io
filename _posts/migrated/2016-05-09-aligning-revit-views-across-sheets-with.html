<p>On Friday I posted a quick video demonstrating how to align views based on a “host” view in Revit with Dynamo. That video can be found below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <iframe width="640" height="650" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/b493c049-6da1-4f99-9a1c-df1d21e77e76" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen></iframe>  <p>Initially, I didn’t realize I would have such a positive reaction to this video so now I will do a better job describing what it does exactly. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NHJ15d6M_MA/VzCjp6E3bAI/AAAAAAAABFg/lrva0IZ8mGc/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p> <p>I had a user at my firm apporoach me and ask the following question, “Is there an easy way to align all of my area plans to the same postion as my first area plan? There are six total across six sheets.”</p> <p>Instantly I remembered some posts regarding “box center” from <a href="https://aecuandme.wordpress.com/">Julian Benoit</a>, so I fired up Dynamo and began to work through this scenario.</p> <p>Considering the individual used the phrase <strong>“same postion as my first area plan”,</strong> I knew I had to make the selection specific<strong> </strong>rather than collecting all viewports and hoping for the best. About a month ago I posted an <a href="http://sixtysecondrevit.blogspot.com/2016/04/isolated-pick-selection-in-revit-with.html">isolated pick selection</a> node in Rhythm and I decided this is perfect for this scenario. (Along with List.Deconstruct)</p> <p>After the user runs the Dynamo graph they are then prompted to select viewports and hit escape when done. Once that is completed Dynamo,</p> <ol> <li>Deconstructs the list into the first “parent” viewport and the rest of the “children” viewports.</li> <li>Gets the box center of the parent viewport.</li> <li>Cycles that location equal to the amount of children viewports.</li> <li>Finally, sets the box center of the children viewports.</li></ol> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DMf_e61wdBY/VzCjqeMGhYI/AAAAAAAABFk/_0mf5qeoqvU/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6i3glF6wtMg/VzCjqqXayxI/AAAAAAAABFo/oRRdlXh7PD4/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="253"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://goo.gl/pMGVaq">Here</a> is the link for the Dynamo graph discussed, remember to download Rhythm and steamnodes to get this working.</p>  <p>As always, let me know if you have any question and have fun!</p> <p>-john</p>
