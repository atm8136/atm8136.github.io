Long title, but it represents a lot of information.<br /><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BbWwyUaWliA/VaaOdPR-xzI/AAAAAAAAAaE/Ksl4ScQF2IQ/s1600-h/iBPOW%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="iBPOW" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8QWCXxXj_xE/VaaOdr2RiQI/AAAAAAAAAaI/8IHFojLve9k/iBPOW_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" height="180" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="iBPOW" width="244" /></a><br />Next week at RTCNA 2015 my BIM manager and I will be teaching a class on optimizing your workflow for building performance. (Session 3.4, Saturday July 25th, 2:30pm)<br />We are going to start out by showing everyone a lot of helpful hints and tricks on how to adapt this workflow for <strong>every</strong> project you do. We will then wrap up with some very helpful optimization tips using DynamoBIM. This will be about the last 15-30 minutes of the presentation.<br />The Dynamo workflows shown are something a beginner or intermediate Dynamo user can begin to recreate and expand upon.<br />I have been using Dynamo since AU2014 after taking Marcello’s beginner classes and have came up with the workflows over the last 6 months. This is why I fell like the average Dynamo user can start to interpret the workflows. Dynamo is something that can help us be more efficient and streamline mundane processes. <br />See you all in DC!<br />-johnp
