Ever since I learned about Dynamo at last years Autodesk University I have been blown away by the possibilities. Since AU2014 I have even launched Rhythm which is a collection of custom nodes. I have been amazed by the feedback from everyone and the support I have received as well. Currently Rhythm sits as 8th most downloaded!<br />One of the nodes I have wanted to create since I learned Dynamo is one to frame interior elevations. Thanks to the Dynamo community this is now possible!<br />In the video below I show four interior elevations on a sheet with the crop region off. The node then toggles the crop on and overrides the crop to a line weight of your choosing!<br /><iframe width="440" height="420" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/67fa8b13-f3ec-4a68-b601-f7e722afba2f" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen></iframe> <br />This was made possible with the help of Danny on the Dynamo forums. <a href="http://dynamobim.com/forums/topic/override-projection-lines-color/" title="http://dynamobim.com/forums/topic/override-projection-lines-color/">http://dynamobim.com/forums/topic/override-projection-lines-color/</a><br /><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C2CjADyKVBA/VlNbhS_7j9I/AAAAAAAAAyY/P2IMqMXpVgg/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Iht57roxcrU/VlNbhh431pI/AAAAAAAAAyc/e1iM6VFZVcg/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" height="166" style="border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline;" title="image" width="244" /></a> <br />This node is now available in Rhythm<br /><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M8513wgqol8/VlNbh7bsFVI/AAAAAAAAAyg/KX0FtgZIk3Q/s1600-h/image%25255B5%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F3dald5JAG8/VlNbiDTIX0I/AAAAAAAAAyk/xuTsL9YBKr0/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" height="162" style="border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline;" title="image" width="244" /></a>
