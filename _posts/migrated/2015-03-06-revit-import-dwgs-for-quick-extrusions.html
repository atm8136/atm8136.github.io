Often times I find myself needing to create signage for our buildings in order to do renderings or have it for the elevations.<br /><br />Sometimes you are lucky enough to get a signage design DWG from a consultant to be able to use. (In a future post I will cover a workaround if you arenâ€™t this lucky)<br /><br />In the past I found myself picking the lines of the DWG, but it is a pain. After some trial I found that you can actually import a DWG right into a sketch! This is especially useful if the signage requires a custom font or shape. My example below is really simple but demonstrates the idea.Check out the video below for the process.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxerWXdsXAg?rel=0" width="420"></iframe>
