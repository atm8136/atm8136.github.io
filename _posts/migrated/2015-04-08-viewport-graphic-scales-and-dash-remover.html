<p>I have previously discussed my graph that removes dashes from sheets at the following link. <a title="http://sixtysecondrevit.blogspot.com/2015/02/dynamo-removing-character-across-entire_25.html" href="http://sixtysecondrevit.blogspot.com/2015/02/dynamo-removing-character-across-entire_25.html">http://sixtysecondrevit.blogspot.com/2015/02/dynamo-removing-character-across-entire_25.html</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>I won’t re-cover what that graph does but what is important is now it is a Rhythm tool. (#3)</p> <p>More importantly, let’s discuss Graphic scales on sheets in Revit. Typically this is a manual process where we place a graphic scale per view. (sometimes all views)</p> <p>The problem is Revit teases us with this delightful bit of information:</p> <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EqpA4Vs7BY0/VSWYbD5gbvI/AAAAAAAAAHw/Cc5dtBOVKuM/s1600-h/2015-04-08_14h47_27%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="2015-04-08_14h47_27" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="2015-04-08_14h47_27" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1i6anqq5NBc/VSWYbpVyp-I/AAAAAAAAAH0/P_0btZfJQ1I/2015-04-08_14h47_27_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="56"></a> As you can see this is the scale factor of our view, but it is grayed out and basically unusable in Revit.</p> <p>Time to use our keyboard shortcut and activate Dynamo for Rhythm tool #4!</p> <p>Below I illustrate how my new tool on Rhythm works. But there are a few things to do first.</p> <ol> <li>Use my Drawing title included in the package  <li>Add the shared parameters included to your project to the views category. (Do’t worry these are hidden parameters that know one will ever know about, it’s our secret)  <li>Name your viewports with the graphic scale showing to contain the words “Graphic Scale” <li>If in a work shared model, it is best to do this with no one else in the model because it does it for all views.</li></ol> <p>In the video below I show the parameters being unusable, how to add the parameters and finally how to use the tool.</p> <p>*Note: you will not see the parameters, but trust me they are there.</p><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtF2m_kdS98?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen></iframe>
