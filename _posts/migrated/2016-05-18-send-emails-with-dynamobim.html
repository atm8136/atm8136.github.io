I had an opportunity to present last year at RTC North America with my BIM Manager. It was an awesome experience and we found ourselves in the top 5 speakers! <br />Our presentation was on Implementing a Building Performance Optimization Workflow. My portion specifically covered, speeding up your workflows with various methods which included Dynamo.<br />During my portion I mentioned that I use Dynamo for everything, including email! <br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/60secondrevit">@60secondrevit</a> uses <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Revit?src=hash">#Revit</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DynamoBIM?src=hash">#DynamoBIM</a> for ALL: Image creation, dashboard, email &amp; slides (OK not email). <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RTCNA?src=hash">#RTCNA</a> <a href="http://t.co/VjJXYeuzpe">pic.twitter.com/VjJXYeuzpe</a></div>â€” Sean David Burke (@seandburke) <a href="https://twitter.com/seandburke/status/625028326453870592">July 25, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> At the time this was a bit of a dream, but we now have this ability in Dynamo with Rhythm! (and the python SMTP.lib) See this node in action below, (apologies for the sound quality)<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8btCnEg5BM" width="420"></iframe> <br />I will be posting this nodes to the Rhythm today, so #GetRhythmForDynamo and have fun!
