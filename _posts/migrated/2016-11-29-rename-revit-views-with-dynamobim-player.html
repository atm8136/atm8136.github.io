Since Dynamo player launched a few weeks ago, I have been having a lot of fun with it! Mostly because Python nodes support User interface additions!<br />Recently, a colleague needed to rename elevations based on level and room location. Very quickly I realized this needed to be done by isolated the elevation heads (views).<br />Thatâ€™s when I went ahead and created this little gem (now available in Rhythm).<br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NBIr6g64jys/WD3L9bbl6OI/AAAAAAAABqU/IIpK3v_0x08/s1600-h/Isolated%252520Pick%252520Model%252520Elements%25255B3%25255D.png"><img alt="Isolated Pick Model Elements" border="0" height="132" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XC9hxgb3Ncg/WD3L9oIWpwI/AAAAAAAABqY/L25du4mDVwY/Isolated%252520Pick%252520Model%252520Elements_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="Isolated Pick Model Elements" width="240" /></a><br />This node allows the user to pick a category to isolate, and select objects of that category by a crossing window or individually.<br />And here it is in action with Dynamo Player.<br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Yy7u6C4G0Fk/WD3L9qos69I/AAAAAAAABqc/JiFexHKE-ZY/s1600-h/dynamoPlayer-renameElevations%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="dynamoPlayer-renameElevations" height="363" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2lHii4kIpdI/WD3L-GAvWMI/AAAAAAAABqg/k6u8YxP7I3M/dynamoPlayer-renameElevations_thumb%25255B1%25255D.gif?imgmax=800" style="display: inline;" title="dynamoPlayer-renameElevations" width="640" /></a><br />Have Fun!<br />-johnP
