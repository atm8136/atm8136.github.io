<br />Every now and then I get a message asking, “Can Dynamo do [insert problem here] in Revit?”<br />Generally, this is exciting! Because this means that people are opening their minds and thinking outside of the Revit box.<br />This question came up ragarding ductwork penetrating fire-rated walls. The indidividual wanted to create a 3D view for every clash of duct and fire-rated wall. Well, I have good news. Thanks to the awesome Dynamo community (steamnodes and clockwork) this is very doable!<br />The video below sums it up, I also include a link for the graph at the end. Note: This does not work for linked models yet. This is very possible and I will post an update in the future.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="420" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/157e3da2-828d-46df-a449-a019aa2d5e90" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="440"></iframe>  <br /><br /><a href="https://goo.gl/bpCYa8" title="https://goo.gl/bpCYa8">https://goo.gl/bpCYa8</a><br /><br />Have fun!<br />-John
