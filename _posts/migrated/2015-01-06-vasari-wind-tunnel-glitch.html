Recently in Autodesk Vasari, I was attempting to run some wind tunnel analysis on conceptual masses. (3 total) My first run worked fine and I could adjust the 2D data slice perfectly. On the 2nd run I noticed that this was not the case, the 2D data slice kept on resetting!&nbsp;<div>After some google searches I found that similar people have experienced this issue and there isn't a predictable cause or a definite solution. Below is a video showing my solution that worked for my case. (I have only tested this on conceptual masses so far.)<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Afthbahgzr8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"></iframe></div>
