<p>A question came up at my firm recently regarding how to quantify the amount of beams a beam system contains in Revit. Currently, this is not easily accessible through the UI, but luckily there is an API method for obtaining the members of the system.</p> <p>This is where Dynamo and python come into play.</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wFPNAYXSAzo/V2FvsTy0RnI/AAAAAAAABIc/6leUAu5v9oc/s1600-h/StructuralBeamSystems.Members%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img title="StructuralBeamSystems.Members" style="display: inline" alt="StructuralBeamSystems.Members" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sIF8Ezvaf9Y/V2FvtHbOd-I/AAAAAAAABIk/ah7HJgwfki4/StructuralBeamSystems.Members_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="640" height="297"></a></p> <p>This node is now in Rhythm, enjoy!</p> <p>-johnP</p>
