I'm not sure if this method has already been shown, but I thought it could be useful to share.<br /><br />Recently we had a project where we had two different packages to be submitted. In these two packages appeared the same building elevations. Easy fix right? Duplicate the views and name with a package designation.<br /><br />Here's the problem:<br />Our user went through the painstaking process of using the line work tool all over the elevation to add depth. These elevations looked really good and we wanted to reuse that same work for the next package while maintaining the original view.<br /><br />After some trial and error we found that duplicate and duplicate with detailing won't work. The magic is in the duplicate as dependent option!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G0nGm8_PDRU/VO47iyv2kBI/AAAAAAAAAAg/mEjqHhT3pcI/s1600/2015-02-25_14h15_18.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G0nGm8_PDRU/VO47iyv2kBI/AAAAAAAAAAg/mEjqHhT3pcI/s1600/2015-02-25_14h15_18.png" height="49" width="320" /></a></div><br />See the video below for a very simple example of this process. I illustrate how the first two options did not work then show how to "orphan" the dependent to save the linework.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_Y7AWYARP8" width="420"></iframe> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />-johnp<br /><br />
