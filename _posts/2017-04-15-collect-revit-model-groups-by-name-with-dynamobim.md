## Collect #Revit Model Groups By Name with #DynamoBIM

Recently a colleague of mine asked if it was possible to collect model groups by name. Given my recent experience with filtering elements by criteria, I figured I would give it a shot in python, (I'm starting to think Rhythm is for my Python exploration and Beaker is for my C# journey).

Enter **Collector.ModelGroupByName**.

This node is now available in Rhythm! 

Have fun!
