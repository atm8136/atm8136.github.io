It's been a little bit of time since I posted and I wanted to take an opportunity to share why.

Currently I am preparing for three (yes three!), awesome Dynamo presentations. All of these presentation are going to have a heavy use of Dynamo player and some of the awesome workflows [Mostafa El Ayoubi](https://data-shapes.net/) has built.

## First up we have the Dynamaniacs of Edmonton Presentation
### Monday February 13th 2017
This is a Dynamo user group that [Carl Storms](https://thebimsider.com/) is starting and I have the honor of being the first presenter!

I think that pretty much sums it up for now, next up AU2017 proposals.
