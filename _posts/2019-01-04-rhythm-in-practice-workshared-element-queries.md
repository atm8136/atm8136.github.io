title: Rhythm in Practice - Workshared Element Queries
---
## Rhythm in Practice

For a while now I have been thinking about reaching out to Dynamo users to see what they use Rhythm for. I thought it would be cool to do a series of blog posts of what real users are doing with the nodes on real projects. To kick this off, I wanted to share this workflow from [Tom K](https://twitter.com/tkunsman), that uses Rhythm nodes that use worksharing queries exposed to us in the Revit API. _(His example uses a single select model element to keep it simple)_ Essentially, we can see who last edited or created an element in a central file. Pretty cool stuff!

If you have a cool workflow that you want to see shared on here, feel free to send me an email or tag me on twitter and I will try to share it.
