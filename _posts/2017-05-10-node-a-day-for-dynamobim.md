## What is node-a-day?

For a while now I have had an idea to start documenting all (or mostly all) of the Dynamo nodes available in the library. 

This seemed like a great opportunity to make some quick videos to demonstrate the nodes and I am able to learn all of the nodes along the way. Right now I cover a node or few per video and the videos are less than 5 minutes typically.

To begin, we will be starting out with the Revit nodes and we see where we end up. Let me know what you think in the comments!
