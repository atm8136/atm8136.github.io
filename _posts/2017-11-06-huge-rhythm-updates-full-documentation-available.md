## Huge Rhythm Updates + Full Documentation Available

For a few weeks now, I have been working hard on some pretty significant Rhythm changes. This includes a ton of new nodes and quite a few replacements/removals. I have been trying to get these updates complete before AU2017 and I am pleased to say the updates are in the version posted today 20171106.

Below you will also find a list of removals and replacements:

Additionally, Rhythm is just about fully documented on Dynamonodes.com. Check out the fully revised Rhythm node index here.

Please, let me know if you have any questions about nodes and I look forward to running into folks at AU2017!
