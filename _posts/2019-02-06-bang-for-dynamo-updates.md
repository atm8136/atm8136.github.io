title: Bang! for Dynamo Updates
---
As you all may know, I really like to hack at Dynamo.

Currently, I manage 3 Dynamo packages that are available on the package manager.

The first is Rhythm which has been around since 2015 and has evolved into a pretty hefty C# zero touch package, They grow up so fast. ðŸ˜¥

Second is Bang, which was released shortly after the Revit 2018.1 update that made the warnings API available to us.

And third is Monocle, which was discussed [here](http://www.parallaxteam.com/monocle-for-dynamo-released/).

Over the years I have had a ton of fun developing these free packages and have received a lot of great feedback and support. One of the common ways people reach out regarding these free packages is the [Dynamo Forum](https://forum.dynamobim.com/). 

Recently, on the forum some of the users [alerted me](https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/bang-for-dynamo-update/25666/21) that an old node (from Bang) would be valuable to have access to once again. These comments lead to a new update to add it back to the package along with a few additional changes.

Now in Bang version 2019.2.6, we have access to an old node and have new cool icons. ðŸ˜Ž

In addition to this, I am pleased to say that Bang is now open sourced as well.

The repository for this Dynamo package is located here, [Bang! for Dynamo](https://github.com/johnpierson/BangForDynamo). 

If you have anything to contribute to the package, please feel free to do so at that resource and thanks to everyone for appreciating the nodes!
