title: 🎨 Dynamo Script Spotlight: The Materials & Finishes Swatch Generator
---
If you’ve ever tried wrangling materials and finishes in Revit, you know the drill: it’s a mix of tedious clicks, endless parameter filling, and the occasional “where the heck did that material go?” moment.

So I built myself a Dynamo sidekick: The Swatch Generator Script 🪄
This script takes a simple input (yep, even just an Excel sheet with finishes listed) and does the heavy lifting of:
✅ Creating materials in Revit directly from structured data
✅ Filling in parameters like Function, Mark, Category, Name, Description, Width, Length, Thickness, Manufacturer, Color Number, Color Name, Finish, URL
✅ Assigning swatches so you can actually see the palette instead of just squinting at text values
✅ Keeping everything consistent, organized, and repeatable across projects

In short: it turns a spreadsheet of chaos into a living materials library inside your model.

⚙️ How It Works
The Inputs
An Excel file (or CSV) with material data structured into columns.
Swatch images can be linked by file path or URL.
The Dynamo Graph
Reads each row of data.
Creates a new Revit material (or updates if it already exists).
Populates all the chosen parameters automatically.
Generates a swatch preview panel right in the project for visual QA.

The Output
A neat grid of material swatches in Revit views.
Auto-tagged with parameters for quick checking.
Ready for schedules, presentations, or “designer mood board” style layouts.


🖼️ Why This Script is a Game-Changer
Instead of manually creating 50 carpet finishes, 30 paint colors, and 20 countertop laminates (😱), you hit run once and let Dynamo handle the heavy lifting. The swatch generator not only speeds up workflows, but also gives you a visual design palette that teams can review together—perfect for presentations, client check-ins, or just keeping sanity intact.

Think of it as your automated finish board, but inside Revit.


🌟 The Fun Part
What I love most is that this isn’t just “automation for the sake of automation.” It’s creative leverage. When you can generate, swap, or rebuild entire finish palettes with a couple of clicks, you free yourself up to actually design, experiment with options, and explore concepts without drowning in repetitive tasks.

Plus, it feels like Dynamo is your design assistant—the kind that doesn’t complain about making 100 swatches in a row.

👀 What’s Next?
I’m already thinking about the next iteration:
Hooking this up to manufacturer websites so the script can scrape and import directly from product libraries
Adding color-coding logic for adjacency diagrams (materials tied to spaces!)
Linking into spec databases so the Revit model isn’t just pretty—it’s spec-ready

Stay tuned. The swatch generator was just the warm-up.

💡 Have you tried building a material workflow in Dynamo before? Did it make your life easier, or just give you new headaches? Drop your war stories—I’d love to compare notes!
