## My #AU2018 Proposals

Well, today is the last day for AU2018 proposals and I managed to "git" one more submitted.

The process for submitting this year was really nice because we were able to resubmit proposals that were previously denied. This was nice because I had a Dynamo player class that I really liked the essence of and with some new content it has only become better. 

This year I was able to submit four proposals. This includes two Dynamo-centric ones and two more general learning topics.

In years past, I have submitted mostly Dynamo and Revit related, but this year I departed from that with some pressure from some of my colleagues over at simplycomplex.org. Two of my proposals are for topics that I am fairly comfortable with but represent a few years of learning them on my own. These proposals are based on Github and Python. The reasoning for this is, as Dynamo becomes more popular we are seeing more users interested in Python and this results in users need to know how to manage their code as well.

As I worked on these proposals I became more excited about them. See below for the titles and a brief description and I hope to see you all at #AU2018!

**Hack Your Dynamo Player: Implementing a User Interface in Dynamo Player**
-In this hands-on lab, attendees will learn how to create awesome, reusable Dynamo User Interfaces for use with Dynamo Player.

**I Shipped My Nodes - How to Create Custom Nodes in Dynamo**
-This class will teach attendees how to begin creating custom Dynamo nodes for reuse in both Revit and FormIt 360 Pro. We will also cover best practices for creating, publishing and creating these custom workflows.

**Hack it 'Til You Crack It - Python in Dynamo for Beginners**
-This class will provide an introduction to using Python in Dynamo from a Revit user's point-of-view. We will cover key terms and relate it all back to Revit terms while making great reusable workflows that you will then be able to share with the Dynamo community.

**Git It Together - An Introduction to Version Control for Revit Users**
-This class will provide an introduction to using a process called version control or Git. This process allows users to manage their code/files in a very efficient way and is an essential tool for anyone learning to code. We will discuss the various platforms to used and define the key terms to know.
