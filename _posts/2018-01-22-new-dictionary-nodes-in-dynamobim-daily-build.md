## New Dictionary Nodes in #DynamoBIM Daily Build

Start of the week with a fresh Dynamo daily build! Today I went ahead and installed the latest Dynamo build from dynamobuilds.com To my excitement, dictionary nodes have appeared!

If you are not familiar with Dictionaries in Dynamo, they can do all kinds of awesome things like provide lookup tools. One of my favorite examples is looking up Revit room elements by their number. I demonstrated this using the old method at the [Advanced Dynamo workshop at AU2017](http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/classes/year-2017/dynamo-studio/bim128342#chapter=0).

Here is the new method.

I also went ahead and made a video to demo this
