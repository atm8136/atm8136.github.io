So I was messing with some model components today and needed a display of dimensions within the component. If you have ever tried to tie a parameter to a dimension before, you'd realize this doesn't work so great.

This is what you normally see.

And of course, this is not what I wanted. I wanted it to be clean like this.

Well luckily Revit 2017 offers calculated parameters in tags now, and with this we can achieve our result.

I show this in action in the GIF below.
