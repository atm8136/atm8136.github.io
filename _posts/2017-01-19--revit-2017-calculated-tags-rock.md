So I was messing with some model components today and needed a display of dimensions within the component. If you have every tried to tie a parameter to a dimension before, you'd realize tihs doesn't work so great.

This is what you normaly see.
![2017-01-19 16_25_32-Autodesk Revit 2017.1 - [Floor Plan_ Ref. Level - 1259-GenericWorkstation__SW].png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2017-01-19 16_25_32-Autodesk Revit 2017.1 - [Floor Plan_ Ref. Level - 1259-GenericWorkstation__SW].png)

And of course, this is not what I wanted. I wanted it to be clean like this.
![2017-01-19 16_26_23-Autodesk Revit 2017.1 - [Floor Plan_ Ref. Level - 1259-GenericWorkstation__SW].png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2017-01-19 16_26_23-Autodesk Revit 2017.1 - [Floor Plan_ Ref. Level - 1259-GenericWorkstation__SW].png)

Well luckily REvit 2017 offers calculated parameters in tags now, and with this we can achieve our result.

I show this in action in the GIF below.
