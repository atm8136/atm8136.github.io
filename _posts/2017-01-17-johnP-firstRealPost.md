So, I wanted to take a moment to create my first post utilizing [markdown format](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and my new github pages blog.

I decided to migrate to this platform for a few reasons,

1. With a lot of change going on right now with my career, I decided it was time for the blog to change as well.
2. This forces me to learn more about GitHub and Markdown formatting.
3. This awesome [Jekyll template](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) looks amazing.

Well, there's a quick update. Thank you all for reading my blog the last few years and I hope you will continue this interesting journey with me here at [sixtysecondrevit.com](www.sixtysecondrevit.com)
