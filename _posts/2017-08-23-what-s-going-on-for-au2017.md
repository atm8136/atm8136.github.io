## What's going on for #AU2017

Well, now that BILTNA is past and fall is coming up quickly, that means AU is coming up quickly too! Below you will find various details about what I am up to this year at AU.


[Flexible Families: Learn to Make Your Families Stretch and Flex Like Never Before ](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=122487&tclass=popup#.WZ2JkiGWITY.twitter)
This year, I am pleased to say that I will be presenting for my first time at AU. My hands on lab is all about adding better grip controls to Revit families and should be a great time. This class actually completely sold out on the first day, which blows me away.


[Computational BIM Workshop—Advanced ](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=128342&tclass=popup#.WZ2KS7Fnh6E.twitter)
In addition to this, I will be co leading the Advanced Dynamo workshop. I have attended this workshop since AU2014 and am very excited to be on the other side now. A large part of my preparation for this workshop has been creating the definition of "an advanced Dynamo user". Not only are we going to define this in a great way, we are going to provide the tools to get everyone there. If you aren't signed up, try to make it to this pre conference event because it should really fun and hopefully inspiring.

And if that is not enough, I will actually be helping out in all of the following labs!

[Dynamo DesignScript for MEP - Jason Boehning](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=123088&tclass=popup#.WZ2LrleXejQ.twitter)
_This is an awesome session from Jason that shows some great workflows for MEP using Dynamo._

[Winning in Revit with Dynamo Player - Masha Pekurovsky](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=124304&tclass=popup#.WZ2Lzj1rIXU.twitter)
_I am very excited for this one. After my Dynamo Player one didn't make the cut, I actually reached out to Masha to offer any help I could. This class is also sold out and should be really fun!_


[Dynamo for Structure - Marcello Sgambelluri](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=125241&tclass=popup#.WZ2L7aXX2ic.twitter)
_Dynamo. Structure. Marcello. I think that is all I need to say._

[Fun with FormIt Pro—A Lab to Hone Your FormIt Skillz - Carl Storms](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=122465&tclass=popup#.WZ2MBIT7jjE.twitter)
_Last year I had the opportunity to help Carl out with another FormIT lab. He definitely has a great way of explaining things. This lab will be great if you want to get started in FormIT. He also hands out some great swag._

Extra thoughts:

I wanted to also take a moment and talk about another very real thing with conferences, rejection. Earlier in my post, I mentioned that this will be my first time speaking at AU. This is completely true. I have submitted 3-4 proposals every year since 2014 and have been denied time and time again, _(so that is roughly 12 denials)_. Even with that track record, it is important to be persistent. I guess I am trying to give some ideas to others who have experienced the same. Be diligent and refine your content each year. My flexible families lab for this year is actually a refined and greatly modified version of a proposal for last year. 

If you are passionate about what you have to share, don't stop sharing. It will get noticed and the community will appreciate it!
