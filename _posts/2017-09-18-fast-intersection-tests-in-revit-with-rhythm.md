## Fast Intersection Tests in #Revit with Rhythm

This weekend I had a chance to play with some pretty nifty intersection methods in the Revit API. I am happy to say this new node is available in the latest version of Rhythm. See the animation below of this in action.

I plan on adding more nodes that are similar in nature. This includes comparing all of a category from one document to another. While these are not ready yet, I wanted to go ahead and release this first one for everyone to check out!

Additionally, in this update are some new simple collection nodes I found useful.

Download Rhythm version 2017.9.17 and have fun!
