## Rhythm #DynamoBIM Compatibility

This post is to document the Rhythm version you need for your version of Dynamo. Why is this needed? With Dynamo 2.0 there was a significant chage to the API that causes packages made in 2.0 to no longer be backwards compatible. I wanted a place for this information to live for people to be able to continue to use Rhythm on older versions.


| Last Supported Dynamo Version | Last Rhythm Version     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Dynamo 2.0.1 | Rhythm v.(tbd) |
| Dynamo 1.3.3 | Rhythm v.2018.8.30 |

I plan on updating Rhythm for Dynamo 2.0 in the next few weeks as well.
