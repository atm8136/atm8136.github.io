## Get #Revit Viewport Outline with #DynamoBIM

A question came up over at the [EvolveLAB Forums](http://www.evolvebim.com/forum) regarding renumbering views on sheet with a spline. Well luckily the Revit API offers a way to get the outline of the viewports on a sheet.

Considering I wanted to share this node with everyone, it is now vailable in Rhythm. If you are wondering about the workflow graph that was used, that will be available on the [EvolveLAB Blog](http://www.evolvebim.com/blog) shortly.

Have Fun!
