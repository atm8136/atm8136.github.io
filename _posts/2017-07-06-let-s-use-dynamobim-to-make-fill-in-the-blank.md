## [This screen wall at CNM in Albuquerque].

This is the first post in a series of posts where I create something I have come across in the real world.

Recently, I came accross this cool screen wall at a local college.

Hmm, looks like a great opportunity for Dynamo! Essentially we need a curved surface with some points "stepping up" from start to end.

See below for what I came up and the link to the Dynamo graph.
